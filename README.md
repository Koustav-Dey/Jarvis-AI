This is a AI Personal Assistant. This is as same as our google assistant. This program is completely developed in Python. It hold much more feature.

As we know Python is a suitable language for script writers and developers. Let’s write a script for Personal Voice Assistant using Python. The query for the assistant can be manipulated as per the user’s need.

The implemented assistant can open up the application (if it’s installed in the system), search Google, Wikipedia and YouTube about the query, calculate any mathematical question, etc by just giving the voice command. We can process the data as per the need or can add the functionality, depends upon how we code things

### Working Process

During a port scan, hackers send a message to each port, one at a time. The response they receive from each port determines whether it's being used and reveals potential weaknesses. Security techs can routinely conduct port scanning for network inventory and to expose possible security vulnerabilities.
